  title={A projection specific logic to sampling visual inputs in mouse superior colliculus},
  abstract={Using sensory information to trigger different behaviors relies on circuits that pass through brain regions. The rules by which parallel inputs are routed to downstream targets are poorly understood. The superior colliculus mediates a set of innate behaviors, receiving input from >30 retinal ganglion cell types and projecting to behaviorally important targets including the pulvinar and parabigeminal nucleus. Combining transsynaptic circuit tracing with in vivo and ex vivo electrophysiological recordings, we observed a projection-specific logic where each collicular output pathway sampled a distinct set of retinal inputs. Neurons projecting to the pulvinar or the parabigeminal nucleus showed strongly biased sampling from four cell types each, while six others innervated both pathways. The visual response properties of retinal ganglion cells correlated well with those of their disynaptic targets. These findings open the possibility that projection-specific sampling of retinal inputs forms a basis for the selective triggering of behaviors by the superior colliculus.

  title={Neural circuits and symbolic processing},
  abstract={The ability to use symbols is a defining feature of human intelligence. However, neuroscience has yet to explain the fundamental neural circuit mechanisms for flexibly representing and manipulating abstract concepts. This article will review the research on neural models for symbolic processing. The review first focuses on the question of how symbols could possibly be represented in neural circuits. The review then addresses how neural symbolic representations could be flexibly combined to meet a wide range of reasoning demands. Finally, the review assesses the research on program synthesis and proposes that the most flexible neural representation of symbolic processing would involve the capacity to rapidly synthesize neural operations analogous to lambda calculus to solve complex cognitive tasks.},

 abstract={Evidence accumulation, an essential component of perception and decision making, is frequently studied with psychophysical tasks involving noisy or ambiguous stimuli. In these tasks, participants typically receive verbal or written instructions that describe the strategy that should be used to guide decisions. Although convenient and effective, explicit instructions can influence learning and decision making strategies and can limit comparisons with animal models, in which behaviors are reinforced through feedback. Here, we developed an online video game and nonverbal training pipeline, inspired by pulse-based tasks for rodents, as an alternative to traditional psychophysical tasks used to study evidence accumulation. Using this game, we collected behavioral data from hundreds of participants trained with an explicit description of the decision rule or with experiential feedback. Participants trained with feedback alone learned the game rules rapidly and used strategies and displayed biases similar to those who received explicit instructions. Finally, by leveraging data across hundreds of participants, we show that perceptual judgments were well described by an accumulation process in which noise scaled nonlinearly with evidence, consistent with previous animal studies but inconsistent with diffusion models widely used to describe perceptual decisions in humans. These results challenge the conventional description of the accumulation process and suggest that online games provide a valuable platform to examine perceptual decision making and learning in humans. In addition, the feedback-based training pipeline developed for this game may be useful for evaluating perceptual decision making in human populations with difficulty following verbal instructions.

  abstract = {Humans are capable of generalizing using the similarity between the abstract features of external stimuli. The neural mechanisms underlying generalization using abstract representations are unclear, and future discoveries would be facilitated by studies in animal models. Here we developed a rat model of generalization by leveraging an existing pulse-based evidence accumulation task, with the abstract rule of choosing the side with the greater number of light pulses. We trained rats (n=14) on different curricula that limit the stimulus-action associations presented during learning and then used test trials to evaluate generalization to novel stimuli. The performance of rats was consistent with a hybrid Exemplar-to-Prototype model of learning. In this model, sensory evidence in the training trials is altered by internal noise providing an expanded perceptual experience to guide generalization. Overall, our study suggests that pulse-based accumulation tasks may be used to study the neural mechanisms of generalization in animals and highlights how noise may support cognition.}

      abstract={A hallmark of human intelligence is the ability to infer abstract rules from limited experience and apply these rules to unfamiliar situations. This capacity is widely studied in the visual domain using the Raven's Progressive Matrices. Recent advances in deep learning have led to multiple artificial neural network models matching or even surpassing human performance. However, while humans can identify and express the rule underlying these tasks with little to no exposure, contemporary neural networks often rely on massive pattern-based training and cannot express or extrapolate the rule inferred from the task. Furthermore, most Raven's Progressive Matrices or Raven-like tasks used for neural network training used symbolic representations, whereas humans can flexibly switch between symbolic and continuous perceptual representations. In this work, we present an algorithmic approach to rule detection and application using feature detection, affine transformation estimation and search. We applied our model to a simplified Raven's Progressive Matrices task, previously designed for behavioral testing and neuroimaging in humans. The model exhibited one-shot learning and achieved near human-level performance in the symbolic reasoning condition of the simplified task. Furthermore, the model can express the relationships discovered and generate multi-step predictions in accordance with the underlying rule. Finally, the model can reason using continuous patterns. We discuss our results and their relevance to studying abstract reasoning in humans, as well as their implications for improving intelligent machines.}

  abstract = {Cross-species studies are important for a comprehensive understanding of brain functions. However, direct quantitative comparison of behaviors across species presents a significant challenge. To enable such comparisons in perceptual decision-making, we developed a synchronized evidence accumulation task for rodents and humans, by aligning mechanics, stimuli, and training. Rats, mice and humans readily learned the task and exhibited qualitatively similar performance. Quantitative model comparison revealed that all three species employed an evidence accumulation strategy, but differed in speed, accuracy, and key decision parameters. Human performance prioritized accuracy, whereas rodent performance was limited by internal time-pressure. Rats optimized reward rate, while mice appeared to switch between evidence accumulation and other strategies trial-to-trial. Together, these results reveal striking similarities and species-specific priorities in decision-making. Furthermore, the synchronized behavioral framework we present may facilitate future studies involving cross-species comparisons, such as evaluating the face validity of animal models of neuropsychiatric disorders.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

  abstract = {When confronting a new challenge in an unfamiliar and puzzling situation, humans can rapidly formulate a hypothesis based on limited interactions and come up with a solution tailored to the specific problem. However, coming up with a quick solution does not guarantee a preferable outcome. It is therefore beneficial to study the representations and neural circuits underlying human reasoning, not only to inspire the development of machines that reason flexibly and quickly like humans, but also to understand how human reasoning may be impaired in certain circumstances or by certain disorders. Here we introduced a framework to discover the representations that could lead to reasoning success and failure in humans, and explored how these representations can be realized with neural circuits. We tested and validated the framework on a human dataset (n=220) collected in our lab on a modified version of the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus. We found that our Message Passing Graph Neural Network, when taking in graphs encoding different relationships and different levels of abstraction, can reproduce human solutions. We then mapped the space of graph representations that lead to error modes in humans to observe the link between topology and functions in reasoning.

We analyzed online behavioral data from 233 participants who engaged in few-shot learning to learn input-output transformation rules from limited examples and apply these to novel problems. Our human subjects (M = 78.9% accuracy) significantly outperformed competing AI programs in the task. While the performance data shows considerable subject- and task-level variability, DBSCAN clustering of first attempt solutions also reveals that on certain tasks, a substantial proportion of participants made similar errors. The findings suggest shared cognitive biases in human abstract reasoning and suggest directions for future research to explore the representational space of problem-solving.}
