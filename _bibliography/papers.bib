  title={Neural circuits and symbolic processing},
  abstract={The ability to use symbols is a defining feature of human intelligence. However, neuroscience has yet to explain the fundamental neural circuit mechanisms for flexibly representing and manipulating abstract concepts. This article will review the research on neural models for symbolic processing. The review first focuses on the question of how symbols could possibly be represented in neural circuits. The review then addresses how neural symbolic representations could be flexibly combined to meet a wide range of reasoning demands. Finally, the review assesses the research on program synthesis and proposes that the most flexible neural representation of symbolic processing would involve the capacity to rapidly synthesize neural operations analogous to lambda calculus to solve complex cognitive tasks.},

 abstract={Evidence accumulation, an essential component of perception and decision making, is frequently studied with psychophysical tasks involving noisy or ambiguous stimuli. In these tasks, participants typically receive verbal or written instructions that describe the strategy that should be used to guide decisions. Although convenient and effective, explicit instructions can influence learning and decision making strategies and can limit comparisons with animal models, in which behaviors are reinforced through feedback. Here, we developed an online video game and nonverbal training pipeline, inspired by pulse-based tasks for rodents, as an alternative to traditional psychophysical tasks used to study evidence accumulation. Using this game, we collected behavioral data from hundreds of participants trained with an explicit description of the decision rule or with experiential feedback. Participants trained with feedback alone learned the game rules rapidly and used strategies and displayed biases similar to those who received explicit instructions. Finally, by leveraging data across hundreds of participants, we show that perceptual judgments were well described by an accumulation process in which noise scaled nonlinearly with evidence, consistent with previous animal studies but inconsistent with diffusion models widely used to describe perceptual decisions in humans. These results challenge the conventional description of the accumulation process and suggest that online games provide a valuable platform to examine perceptual decision making and learning in humans. In addition, the feedback-based training pipeline developed for this game may be useful for evaluating perceptual decision making in human populations with difficulty following verbal instructions.

  abstract = {Humans are capable of generalizing using the similarity between the abstract features of external stimuli. The neural mechanisms underlying generalization using abstract representations are unclear, and future discoveries would be facilitated by studies in animal models. Here we developed a rat model of generalization by leveraging an existing pulse-based evidence accumulation task, with the abstract rule of choosing the side with the greater number of light pulses. We trained rats (n=14) on different curricula that limit the stimulus-action associations presented during learning and then used test trials to evaluate generalization to novel stimuli. The performance of rats was consistent with a hybrid Exemplar-to-Prototype model of learning. In this model, sensory evidence in the training trials is altered by internal noise providing an expanded perceptual experience to guide generalization. Overall, our study suggests that pulse-based accumulation tasks may be used to study the neural mechanisms of generalization in animals and highlights how noise may support cognition.}
