Can a point be pointless, and if so is that still a point? Is making a pointless point the same as making a point? And what is the point of making a pointless point? Is a point a dot, a mark, a period, an action, an intention, a purpose or an opinion, and is making a pointless point the equivalent of deleting a dot, erasing a mark, taking away a period, inverting an action, removing any intention, giving up on a purpose and throwing away an opinion? But isnt't doing so the equivalent of exerting an action, demonstrating an intention, expressing an opinion, and pursuing a purpose? So how can a point ever be pointless, and how can making a pointless point ever not the same as making a point?
