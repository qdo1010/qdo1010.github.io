As these words are being written, or typed up, microscopic light emitting diodes radiate photons accordingly, some hitting neurons and causing long term structural changes, so much so that these cells can replay the same sequence of words for years to come. As soon as an appropriate combination of keys is pressed, electrons also get trapped in nanoscopic structures and all the content written to this point are also saved for years to come. 

But words written here are tied to the existence of the laptop and the person writing these words. Unless the person writing these words decide to embed these words in electromagnetic wave and deliver them to a remote data center, in which case the existence of these words is now tied to the existence of electrons in nanoscopic structures elsewhere. And if an individual elsewhere requested electromagnetic waves containing these words to be delivered to them via the data center, microscopic light emitting diodes would radiate photons accordingly, some hitting neurons causing long term structural changes, in which case these words now live in the memory of the said individual. 

There is also a scenario where these words are typed up but deleted or forgotten, in which case they live in the void. Photon hitting neurons making no impact and electron charge gets dropped to none. Are words not yet written, or are they simply being written to the void?
