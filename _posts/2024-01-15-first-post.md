Struggling to write even the first few words for this because this site should not have been made in the first place, for so many reasons not yet written, but now that it's somewhat taking shape, it would be a waste to leave it unfinished. Still hesitating to put in more words though. So many words were written and deleted. So much time has passed. It amazes me that these are the words left untouched. 

{% quote %}
I always find comfort in words placed here. If writing is anything like musical composition, then these words are both tension and release.

And if struggling is the first word that starts this post, what is the best word to indicate the end.
