Hi, I am writing something down just to check if the page will be updated. 
Not sure what else to write down yet...But should I write something just to fill the empty space? 
What is there to write about? Why is there a need to write something down now that the empty space is filled?
Instead of words why can't I write with :no_mouth: :zipper_mouth_face: :shushing_face:?
And instead of sentences and paragraphs and goal and directionality, how else can I arrange my :thinking:?
Just [wandering & wondering](https://qdo1010.github.io/blog/), with words yet to be written.
