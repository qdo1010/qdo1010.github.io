Hi, this is a sentence with words in it. It was typed on a laptop and now it is written.  
Not sure what else to write down yet...But should I keep writing down something just to fill the empty space? 
What can I write about? And why is there a need to write something down now that the empty space is filled?

Instead of words can I write with :no_mouth: :zipper_mouth_face: :shushing_face:?
And instead of sentences and paragraphs and aims and goals, how else can I arrange my :thinking:?
Just [wandering & wondering](https://qdo1010.github.io/blog/), with words yet to be written...
